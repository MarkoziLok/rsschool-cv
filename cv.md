# My goal is to learn programming. I am diligent and want to learn. I worked as a furniture maker, helper, handyman. At the moment, I'm the community editor.
# I don't have any programming skills. I studied JS on my own before the course.
# My last code:
```
const myInf = {
  years: 17,
  growth: 187,
  weight: 69
}
const {years} = myInf
console.log(years)
const myMass = [17,187,69]
const [yearsMass] = myMass
console.log(yearsMass)
console.table(myInf)
const myFn = ({years,growth}) => {
  if (!years) {
    return `${growth} is growth, years is undefind`
  }
  return `Growth ${growth}, years ${years}`
}
console.log(myFn(myInf))
if(!myInf.name){
  console.log('Имя не указанно!!!')
}
if(myInf.name){
  console.log('Имя')
}else{
  console.log('Имя отсутствует!!!')
const age = 17
if(age>=18){
  console.log('Is adult')
}
if(age>=12 && age<18){
  console.log('Is teenager')
}
if(age<12){
  console.lod('Is child')
```
